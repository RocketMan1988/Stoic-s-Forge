# Catholicism:

## Introduction:
I’m not opposed to a universal church. In fact, I will go as far as to say that the concept is the best model for the Church of Christ. However, just as communism is a great theory, but doesn't always work as well as capitalism: A universal church doesn’t always work well in practice. The doctrine taught by a universal church would have to be 100% sound. It is in my opinion that Catholic church has not established doctrines that 100% reflect the truth taught by Jesus in the Bible. 

It’s a bold claim to make that you are the One true church. Pointing your authority directly coming from Jesus. It’s a claim many offshoots of the Christian Faith have made since the death of Christ. Mormonism, Catholicism(Roman Catholic), Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East all have made this claim. It’s a claim that is hard to prove and they all point to different verses to support their claim(s).

Anyone can make a claim. Christian faiths make claims all the time, but it is only through careful consideration and prayer that we should accept these claims. Emphasis on careful consideration(See Section on [[Lead by the Holy Spirit]]). It is my opinion that many Christians are too quick to accept claims. Not testing them for validity. It is far easier to believe that someone has been given the “truth” and then trust what they teach. It is a much more difficult task to test what they give you. I’ve seen a lot of my Roman Catholic Church brethren, as well as Protestant brethren, remain ignorant in what their faith actually teaches them or the reason for those teachings. As the saying goes: “Ignorance is Bliss.”

It is my goal to test many of these beliefs and to come out the other side more knowledgeable and understanding of all sides of Christianity.
