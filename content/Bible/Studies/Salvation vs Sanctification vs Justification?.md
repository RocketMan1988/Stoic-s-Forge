## Salvation vs Sanctification vs Justification?
1.  Catholicism: 
	1.  They are both parts of the same process of obtaining salvation.
	2.  Justification occurs at baptism. (Water i assume?) It is the first step in our walk to become saved.
	3.  Justification is the remission of our sins and our entrance into the Christian life.  We are initially justified at baptism and then each time we go to confession and finally in our final judgment.
	4.  Sanctification is the growth of grace and charity in a person.  Once our sins our forgiven we must grow in holiness and will continue to do so throughout our lives until our final judgment.
	5.  Ongoing justification is signification
	6.  Works apart from grace cannot even contribute to our salvation according to the Catholic Church. Instead it takes a combination of what Christ did for us plus
2. Protestant:
	1. Believe in Believers Baptism - baptism comes at the moment of believing vs being baptized.
	2. Justification: 
		1. Is God's declaration that a sinner is righteous through the work of Jesus Christ.
		2. Rom. 3.24; 4.1-5; 5.1; 2 Cor. 5.21, Tit. 3.7.
	4. Sanctification: 
		1. Sanctification is God's transformation of a believer's whole being, that is the mind, will, behaviors, and affections through the work of the Holy Spirit.
		2. Rom. 6; 8; Tit. 3.5; 1 Thess. 4.3, 5.23; Heb. 12.14; 2 Pet. 3.18; Jud. 1.20.
		3.  Justification happens outside of you, you are declared righteous.
		4.  Sanctification happens inside of you, you are made righteous.
		5.  Justification is a one-time event, and sanctification is a continual process. When we are justified, we are declared righteous positionally (that is, before God we are righteous). However, while we are positionally righteous, we are practically not perfectly righteous. While doubtless growing in grace, we are still, when compared to Christ, unrighteous. Sanctification then is the gradual conformity to the likeness of Christ. In other words, sanctification is the gradual process of becoming practically what we are positionally (righteous).
		6.  Justification is not being made righteous.
		7.  Justification is not based upon what we do.
		8.  Justification is something that God does for us; sanctification is what God does with us. Justification is by grace through faith, while sanctification is by grace applied in life.
3. Infinite Baptism:
4.  Nature of Christ
3.  People living in sexual sin:
	1.  1 Corinthians 5:9-13: We can associate with sexually immoral people outside the church. We are not to judge them for God will judge them instead. However we are not to associate with folks inside the church who are sinning openly. We are not even to eat with them.
