# Translations of the Bible

What translation of the Bible to use is an important question to ask. There are so many translations of the Word that always seem to be a new one every year. When considering translations a couple of things should be considered:


**Word-for-Word Vs Thought-for-Thought:**

            Generally speaking, for English Bibles, there are two dominant translation methodologies: Word-for-Word and Thought-for-Thought.


In Word-for-Word translations, translators attempt to translate each word in the original language into an equivalent English word.

These translations are generally considered more “literal.”

In Thought-for-Thought translations, translators attempt to translate the message/meaning of the original-language texts into an equivalent English word or expression.

These translations are generally less literal on a word-for-word basis but still seek to capture the meaning of the original-language texts.

It’s important to note that the Bias of the translator more easily makes it into Thought-for-Thought translations than Word-for-Word translations. However, Word-for-Word translations make it easier for the reader to miss-understand the cultural context and miss-interpret the text. There are landmines in both types of translations.

I tend to believe the best translation is the Word-for-Word translations and the usage of multiple Study Bible notes from multiple sources. The ESV Study Bible does a decent job of presenting an array of alternative beliefs associated with a text, but tends to lean heavily on Protesant beliefs. That’s also why I have an Ignatius Catholic Study Bible to compare with some Catholic Beliefs.

## Last Major Revision:

As time progresses our translation of the bible tends to get better since scholars have more resources to understand cultural differences. Plus they have access to more older texts. As a result, Bibles like the King James Version, although beautiful and poetic, are no longer the best source to utilize. That being said King James does still have its place. It was written intentionally in a poetic manner to make memorization easy. There are also a considerable amount of commentaries written over the past 400 or so years since it served as the primary english bible for so long.

It’s important to realize that all beliefs are rooted in faith in something. An Atheist roots their understanding of the world with faith that there is no god. A Theist roots their faith in an understanding that there is a god. Every protesant and catholic have some central beliefs that they root themselves in. 

One common disagreement between catholics is [[Sola Scriptura]] or the one infallible source of authority for Christian faith is the scriptures.
