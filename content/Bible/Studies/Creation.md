- [[Naming in Biblical Times]]
- Some Scholars consider "days" of creation as extended periods of time of an uncertain length or a rhetorical device by which to account of creation is structured.
- [[Gen-01#v21]] - The cerb created emphasizes God's authority over large [[Sea Creatures]]. Israel's neighbors worshiped [[Rahab]] a mythical sea monster.
* [[God's use of Plural Pronouns]]
* [[Gen-01#v31]] - God adds VERY to good for the final look at creation.
