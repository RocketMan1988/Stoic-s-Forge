### Summary
* Some scholars believe in the gap theory that states the "was" should be translated as "became" within [[Gen-01#v2]]. 
* Scholars use the gap theory to explain the origins of evil and the first fall of Satan and his angels. [[Isa-14#v12]] to [[Isa-14#v21]] and [[Ezek-28#v12]] to [[Ezek-28#v19]]
* The construction of the sentence favors a translation of was rather than became. Early scholars translated it as "was" too which adds some more credibility.
