5/1/2023:
* Unknown issue with urine. Dr thinks maybe UTI that has passed thanks to drinking a lot of water. Possibly Kidney Stones but excepts much more pain before. He did think that they looked like Kidney Stones in formation though. 
* Recommended that during my next physical I get a ua2 blood test (To see if there is blood in the urine). (There was a small pink substance on the bathtub that we weren't sure if it was from my utination or not.)
* If problem comes up again then need to get tested.
