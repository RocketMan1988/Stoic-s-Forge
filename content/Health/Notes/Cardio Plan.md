### Notes
- Your body will adapt to your cardio workout - You need to use progressive overload
- Establish a Baseline - Low intensity - 10 min of incline walking
- Gradually Increasing these sessions by 5-10 mins or increase speed or incline. Progress as you hit a weight level off
- Don't compensate - Don't become lazier aka less active. Instead do these things
	- Keep your step count the same 
	- Lift weights regularly
	- Monitor your calorie intake
- Maintain your body after you hit your body weight
