Exercises that target certain muscles

Here’s an example of some exercises you can perform to target each muscle group.

### **Chest**

1.  [**Bench press:**](https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/bench-press-muscles-worked) You can use a barbell or dumbbells. It’s a good idea to have a partner spot you in case you get stuck.
2.  [**Push-ups:**](https://www.healthline.com/health/push-ups-for-beginners) Increasing the width of your hands puts an emphasis on your chest muscles
3.  **Band [chest press](https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/chest-press#how-to):** Hook a band with handles behind you and push away from your body as if you’re passing a basketball.

### **Back**

1.  **One-arm [dumbbell row](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/upright-row):** Helps strengthen your upper back, shoulder, and upper arms.
2.  [**Resistance band pull apart:**](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-start-lifting-weights#weight-training-exercises) Hold a resistance band with your hands shoulder-width apart. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull the band.
3.  **Superman:** To make the exercise harder, you can hold a weight in your hands over your head.

### **Arms**

1.  **Biceps curls:** If you don’t have access to dumbbells, you can use soup cans or other heavy household objects.
2.  **[Triceps dips:](https://www.healthline.com/health/chair-dips#how-to-do)**Works both your triceps and chest.
3.  **[Pull-ups:](https://www.healthline.com/health/pull-ups#how-to)**Pull-ups work your upper back, shoulders, core, and arms.

### **Abdominal**

1.  [**Plank:**](https://www.healthline.com/health/14-plank-variations-your-core-will-thank-you-for-later#1) Support yourself on your forearms and toes with your abdominals and core flexed.
2.  **Bicycle crunches:** The twisting motion in this exercise helps target the muscles at the side of your core called your obliques.
3.  **[Hanging leg raises:](https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/v-cut#exercises)** You can start with your knees at 90 degrees for an easier variation and progress to straight legs as the exercise becomes more difficult.

### **Legs**

1.  **[Squat:](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/proper-squat-form#start-with-squat-therapy)**You can perform bodyweight squats, use dumbbells, or a barbell.
2.  [**Lunges:**](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/lunges-muscles-worked#how-to) There are many variations of the lunge including walking dumbbell lunges, reverse lunges, and barbell lunges.
3.  **[Calf raises:](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/how-to-get-rid-of-cankles#1)**You can start with your body weight and add weight as they become easier.

### **Shoulders**

1.  **Seated shoulder press:** It’s a good idea to have a partner help you get the weights into place to avoid injuring your shoulders.
2.  **Resistance band shoulder press:** You can stand in the middle of a large resistance band with handles and push your hands toward the ceiling.
3.  **Plank with arms straight:** This exercise helps work your core, shoulders, and back.

## **Best Muscle Group Combinations & Exercises**

### **Upper Body – Front & Back**

Your biceps work with the abs and back muscles to execute pulling movements while the triceps team up with chest and shoulder muscles to complete pushing movements. Working out these closely related muscle groups during the same workout session is ideal because one group can rest while the other is working.

That means you can work both to exhaustion without long rest periods that will kill your drive. Alternating between bicep/back exercises and triceps/chest/shoulder ones allows you to fully exhaust both muscle groups, which will increase hypertrophy after the workout is finished to build greater strength and increase muscle growth

## **Best Upper Body & Chest Exercises**

### **1. Incline Chest Press**

This move provides most of the same benefits of a bench press without requiring you to break form and adjust weights or fuss around with bumper plates. You’ll need dumbbells and an incline bench set between 45 and 60 degrees.

Lie on the incline bench facing up with your feet flat on the ground. Pick up one dumbbell in each hand using an overhand grip (palms facing ahead of you) before raising them more or less above your eyes with your elbows almost straight.

Take a deep breath in while you slowly lower the dumbbells toward the top of your chest. Move them to the outside of your torso when they get near to it. Exhale and push the weights back up to the starting position, taking care to keep your elbows directly underneath your wrists throughout the exercise.

![A man doing dumbbell rows in a gym.](https://blog.fitplanapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mike-o-plan-image-1024x502.jpg)

Dumbbell rows are a great way to add muscle to your upper back.

### **2. One-Arm Dumbbell Rows**

Build a massive back with this move. All you need is a flat bench and a dumbbell. Place the dumbbell to one side of the bench where you can reach it and then get into the starting position.

Put your left leg onto the bench and grab the left side of the bench with your left hand. Next, bend your torso until it’s parallel with the ground. Pick up the dumbbell with your palm facing your body.

Bring the dumbbell up to your chest by hinging your elbow. Make sure you’re lifting with your shoulders and [back muscles](https://blog.fitplanapp.com/the-7-best-back-workouts-for-mass/) rather than your arms. The biceps will get a nice workout incidentally anyway.

Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position. Complete all your reps with the right arm before switching to the left side to do the same number.

### **3. Dumbbell Triceps Kickbacks**

You can do these kickbacks with or without a bench. If you don’t have one handy, just bend your knees slightly and hinge at the hips until your forehead is nearly facing the ground.

Take a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other. Maintain a straight spine and tuck your elbows in at your sides. Lift the weights until your elbows are at a 90° angle and then lower them until your arms are straight.

Your hands should be slightly behind your body when your elbows are straight. Count off one rep each time you return to the 90° angle.

### **4. Lat Pulldowns**

The lat pulldown machine is the easiest way to perform this exercise but you can still give your latissimus dorsi a great workout by approximating this move with a resistance band and a horizontal object like a broomstick. There’s no better way to work that specific muscle than pulldowns.

If you’re using a machine, sit down and put the pad down so that your legs are secured. This resistance is what prevents the resistance in this exercise from pulling your body upward, which wouldn’t allow your body to build stronger [muscle fibers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21912291/) like it does during resistance training. 

Grab the overhead bar with a wide reverse grip. Meaning with your palms facing behind you. The reverse grip activates your back and forearm muscle groups with less emphasis on the biceps brachii, which is better for overall strength and functionality. 

Retract your shoulder blades and pull the bar down to the front of your chest. Resist the temptation to lean forward. Slowly lift the bar back to the starting position to complete one rep.

### **5. Barbell Overhead Press**

This is a favorite bodybuilding move but it may require building strength with similar moves like the seated dumbbell shoulder press. Once you do have the necessary strength and wrist mobility, though, the overhead press has tons of muscle-building potential.

If you’re new to weightlifting, you may want to have a personal trainer or more experienced lifter nearby to spot you. Take the barbell off the rack and hold it with your palms shoulder-width apart and facing the ceiling. The bar should be on the front of your shoulders.

Press the bar directly overhead and then return it to shoulder level. Make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades and tilt your head up so that that barbell doesn’t hit your chin or nose.

### **6. Hammer Curls**

Hammer curls activate the biceps, brachialis, and brachioradialis, three individual muscles that are hugely important for moving the elbow. You really have to use dumbbells for this move because kettlebells and other weights don’t allow for the necessary wrist movement to happen.

Stand with your feet together and make sure your back is straight. Don’t lock your knees or back in place, just engage your core muscles to provide some extra stability. Pick up a dumbbell in each hand with the weights facing forward and behind you, respectively. Your palms should face your body and your thumbs should face forward.

Starting with the weights down by your sides, slowly lift until your thumbs are near your shoulders and your elbows are bent at a ninety-degree angle. Lower them back to the starting position to complete one rep.

## **Back & Core**

The muscles on both sides of your torso work to stabilize much of your body. They attach to your spine and are involved in every movement between your upper and lower body. Strengthening each will help you achieve better balance and [prevent injury](https://uhs.princeton.edu/sites/uhs/files/documents/Lumbar.pdf).

If you want a chiseled 6-pack, you have to develop your back and oblique core muscles as well. Otherwise, your athletic and everyday performance will suffer and you’ll be significantly more prone to injuries. Luckily, many of these exercises can be done with bodyweight only and don’t require fancy equipment or a gym membership.

## **Best Back & Core Exercises**

### **1. Crunches**

This straightforward exercise is an essential part of any training program that aims to build core strength. All you need to do is lie down on the ground with the soles of your feet planted hip-width apart and your spine and head aligned. Cross your arms over your chest.

Relax your neck and shoulders while engaging your core. Tuck your chin and lift your upper back while leaving your lower back on the floor. Rise until you’re as close to your knees as possible and then return to the starting position.

![A woman in a pink outfit doing a plank in a gym.](https://blog.fitplanapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4Y1A8682-1024x683.jpg)

The world record plank is 8 hours, 15 minutes, and 15 seconds. But you don’t need to plank for hours to reap the benefits.

### **2. Plank**

The position for planking is similar to a push-up, except you’ll have your forearms on the ground instead of just your palms. It builds tremendous core and back strength, but it’s actually a full-body workout that will build strength in many muscles throughout the body.

Support your lower body with your toes and make sure your elbows are directly underneath your shoulders. Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels. Drive your elbows into the ground and engage your glutes, core, and quads. Hold that position for as long as you can before resting and repeating one or two times.

### **3. Mountain Climbers**

Mountain climbers [strengthen your core](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/the-real-world-benefits-of-strengthening-your-core) while adding in a bit of cardio that will also provide countless health benefits like a better-functioning nervous system. They’re a great warm-up, cooldown, or interval exercise for HIIT workout routines.

Repeat the same stance as you did in the plank exercise described just above this one. Rather than staying still, lift your right knee up to your chest, taking care not to break your stance. As you lower the right leg back down, bring the left knee up to the chest. 

Continue for the same number of reps on each leg to ensure you build strength evenly.

### **4. Bicycle Crunch**

This crunch variation keeps your abs under constant tension, which makes it great for reaching muscle exhaustion in your core. Get into the same position you got into for the crunch we described at the beginning of this section.

Bend your right knee toward your chest and extend your left leg, lifting it off the ground slightly. Lift your upper back and bring your left shoulder to meet your right knee. Bring your left shoulder back to the ground and switch leg positions, then repeat the same motion on the other side of the body.

## **Legs & Lower Body**

A great deal of our bodies’ functional strength comes from muscle groups in our lower body, notably the glutes, [hamstrings](https://blog.fitplanapp.com/best-hamstring-exercises-for-women/), and quads. Building lower-body strength can prevent injuries that might otherwise impair your ability to get around or continue with your workout routine. 

Leg day is an integral part of any bodybuilding program. Even if you do build big muscles in your arms, you’ll need lower-body strength to prevent becoming too top-heavy.

## **Best Leg & Lower Body Exercises**

![A man doing lunges in a gym.](https://blog.fitplanapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4Y1A3624-2-1-1-1024x683.jpg)

Lunges are very versatile as you can build both strength and endurance with them.

### **1. Lunges**

You can make this bodyweight exercise more challenging with a resistance band or you can do the “walking” variety to get a bit of extra [cardio](https://blog.fitplanapp.com/does-cardio-kill-your-gains/) during your workout. Your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves will all be a target with lunges.

Start from a standing position with your hands on your hips or holding weights if you want to build some upper-body strength at the same time. Take a large step forward with one leg and keep moving your upper body forward by bending the leading knee until it’s at a 90° angle. 

Your rear knee should get close to the ground without touching it. Make sure your leading knee doesn’t pass your toes and try to get your rear shin parallel with the floor. Push through your leading heel to get back into the starting position and repeat the same process with the other leg in front.

### **2. Leg Extensions**

There’s a dedicated machine at the gym for leg extensions. All you need to do is set your weight and get into the machine with the pad securing your thighs in place. Place your hands on the bars at either side and then lift the weight with your legs until they’re almost straight. 

Bring the weight back down and repeat. The quadriceps are the main beneficiaries of this exercise.

### **3. Barbell Hip Thrust**

A favorite of lifters who get their routine finished from a home gym, you can substitute the barbell in this exercise with any weighted object that you can keep in position. They also call this move a glute bridge because it builds so much strength there. It also works the entire back of your legs.

Get into a position as if you were about to do crunches: back flat, feet planted on the ground hip-width apart. Take the barbell and place it on your lap right where your hips bend. Instead of raising your back off the ground like you would in a crunch, lift your hips by pushing through your heels.

Lift your hips until there’s a straight line running from your neck to your knees. Hold that position for a few seconds and then lower your hips.

### **4. Bulgarian Split Squat**

Find an elevated surface or bench for this exercise. Stand in front of it and then extend your right leg behind you and place your toes on the elevated surface. Make sure you have good posture and then slowly lower your torso by bending your left knee. 

Stop when your left knee is a 90° angle. Your right knee should almost touch the floor, but not quite. Rise to the starting position and repeat all your reps on the left knee before switching to the other leg.
